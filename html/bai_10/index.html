            <h3>Run the Messier Marathon</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/img/m20.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              It's time for the annual <b>Messier Marathon</b>. Instead of
              lacing up their Nikes, amateur astronomers will be hauling
              telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night
              vigil hunting the Messier objects. <br /><br />
              <b>Messier objects</b> are stellar objects, classified by
              astronomer <b>Charles Messier</b> in the 18th century, ranging
              from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. Now is
              the only time of the year in which all 110 Messier objects are in
              the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have
              to start looking right after sunset and continue until just before
              sunrise — hence the term, "marathon>." <br /><br />Ironically,
              Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made
              the list in order to avoid seeing them. Messier was more
              interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar
              objects kept getting in the way.
